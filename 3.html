  Many of the best known events in Indonesian history took place on Java.
  It was the centre of powerful Hindu-Buddhist empires, the Islamic sultanates, and the core of the colonial Dutch East Indies.
  Java was also the center of the Indonesian struggle for independence during the 1930s and 1940s.
